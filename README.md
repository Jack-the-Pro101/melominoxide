# Melominoxide

A simple nice looking Discord presence that syncs with listening to the Minecraft OST in VLC media player built using Rust.

This project is mainly intended for personal use.

## Prerequisites

- VLC media player installed
- The original Minecraft music files as .ogg with metadata for title, artists, album. Note: the game file do not contain this metadata, I wrote a simple script to populate this data. FYI: I found a couple tracks did not seem to be super published online so I had to add their metadata manually.
- A xspf playlist of Minecraft music for VLC to open
